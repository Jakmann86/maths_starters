# maths_starters
A React application featuring years worth of iGCSE year 11 maths starters.
There are 34 weeks of iGCSE maths starters (Use scroll down menu to select week) with answers and challenge questions.
Each week has 3 seperate starters (in a last week, last lesson, last topic, last year framework) which can be navigated using the chevrons.
Each starter has the topic title and a dynamic date.
Looking to add shapes and diagrams in the future and hopefully build thgis up toi full Maths website.
